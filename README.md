# Snowflake AI Toolkit
Snowflake AI Toolkit is an AI Accelerator and Playground for enabling AI in Snowflake. It is an Plug and Play Streamlit based Native App that can be used to explore, learn and build rapid prototypes of AI Solutions in Snowflake powered by the Snowflake's Cortex and AI Functions. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Snowflake Account**: An active Snowflake account with Cortex functionalities enabled.
- **Role Permissions**: ACCOUNTADMIN or equivalent role with permissions to create:
  - Stages
  - Databases
  - Other resources
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.
- **Streamlit**: Installed on your local machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgsshankar/Snowflake-AI-Toolkit.git
   cd snowflake-ai-toolkit
   ```

2. Install dependencies (only required for local development):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   All necessary libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup

The application will automatically handle:
- Database creation
- Stage setup
- Required resource initialization

Make sure your Snowflake role has the necessary privileges for these operations.

To configure the application mode, update the `mode` parameter in `src/settings_config.json`:
- Set to `"debug"` for local development and editing.
- Set to `"native"` for running natively in Snowflake.

## Running the App

### Locally

Launch the application locally using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

### Natively on Snowflake

To deploy the application natively in Snowflake, use the following command:
   ```bash
   snow streamlit deploy --account "<your_account>" --user "<your_username>" --password "<your_password>" --role "<your_role>" --warehouse "<your_warehouse>" --database "<your_database>" --replace
   ```

Replace the placeholders (`<your_account>`, `<your_username>`, etc.) with your actual Snowflake account details. When running natively in Snowflake, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` is not needed.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Snowflake Permission Errors**
   - Verify role privileges for database and stage creation
   - Ensure Cortex functionalities are enabled

2. **Dependency Issues**
   - If pandas/pyarrow installation fails:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas pyarrow
     ```

3. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify Snowflake account credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper role assignments
