## [1.2.0] — June 2026

### Added

#### CocoLean — Minimum Viable Cortex Surface (Feature 43)
- `cocolean/lean.skill.md` — `$lean`, `$lean lite`, `$lean full`, `$lean ultra` activate the six-rung Cortex-adapted decision ladder and set the intensity mode in `.cocoplus/modes/lean.mode`; intensity persists across sessions; three intensity levels: lite (ladder only), full (all modes, default), ultra (full + enforcement — contested Rung 1 requires explicit rationale before `$plan` proceeds)
- `cocolean/lean-review.skill.md` — `$lean review` invokes `lean-review.js` (deterministic, no LLM, Tier 1 latency) to scan the current git diff and apply five classification tags in severity order: `delete` (no callers, no tests, no spec reference), `yagni` (speculative abstractions), `stdlib` (reimplemented built-ins — includes replacement construct), `native` (AI function better expressed as native Snowflake object — includes recommended type), `shrink` (verbose single-operation implementation); carve-outs (trust boundaries, security controls, compliance) are always exempt
- `cocolean/lean-debt.skill.md` — `$lean debt` invokes `lean-debt.js` (deterministic harvest, Haiku narrative layer) to scan all `cocoplus:` markers across the CocoPod; each marker carries `simplified=`, `ceiling=`, `trigger=` fields; findings ranked by `ceiling_imminence × days_since_annotation`; report committed to `.cocoplus/lifecycle/lean-debt.md`
- `scripts/lean-review.js` — deterministic diff scanner; reads staged + unstaged git diff; applies stdlib/native/yagni/shrink/delete patterns via regex and AST matching; checks declared requirements in `spec.md` and `discuss.md` for yagni/delete classification; no LLM
- `scripts/lean-debt.js` — deterministic `cocoplus:` marker harvester; walks all project files; extracts three required fields; calculates ceiling imminence from project metrics (`dora-snapshot.json`, `flow.json`, seed count); ranks by `ceiling_imminence × days_since_annotation`; outputs JSON; LLM narrative is added by the skill layer

### Updated

#### CocoBehavior — Minimum Viable Function Ladder (Feature 22 Enhancement)
- `cocobehavior/SKILL.md` v1.2.0: Constraint 6 added — Minimum Viable Function Ladder; six-rung pre-build checklist embedded as compact constraint; fires before any tool call that creates a new Cortex function, stage handler, or subagent definition; advisory by default, enforcing in `$lean ultra` mode; carve-outs match CocoLean's non-negotiable exemptions; closing paragraph updated to "six constraints"; Exit Criteria updated from four to six

#### CocoReview — Phase 6 Complexity Audit (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` v1.2.0: Step 7c added — Phase 6 Complexity Audit; applies five CocoLean classification tags (`delete`/`stdlib`/`native`/`yagni`/`shrink`) to the Cortex function layer of the reviewed artifact; tag distribution summary (`delete:[N] stdlib:[N] native:[N] yagni:[N] shrink:[N]`) required in every report; mandatory `praise` finding when artifact shows complexity restraint; carve-outs match CocoLean exemptions; Phase 6 always runs (not routed by flags); output template updated with "Complexity Audit (Phase 6)" section; Exit Criteria updated to require Phase 6 tag distribution summary

#### Persona Agent Files — Character Backstories
- `data-engineer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — pipeline failure modes, upstream schema assumptions, contract between teams
- `analytics-engineer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — metric definition discipline, dashboard number disagreements
- `data-scientist.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — plausible-vs-correct distinction, evaluation metric as hypothesis
- `data-analyst.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — ad-hoc query documentation discipline, assumption capture
- `bi-analyst.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — dashboard usage decay, decision-enablement test before design
- `data-product-manager.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — specified-vs-needed gap, decision-enablement framing
- `data-steward.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — undocumented schema assumptions as organizational debt
- `chief-data-officer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — organizational absorption rate, operationalizability over elegance

#### Plugin Manifest
- `plugin.json` v1.2.0: skills array gains `cocolean/lean`, `cocolean/lean-review`, `cocolean/lean-debt`; scripts array gains `scripts/lean-review.js`, `scripts/lean-debt.js`

## [1.1.1] — June 2026

### Added

#### CocoAudit — Session Audit Trail (Feature 40)
- `cocoaudit.skill.md` — `$audit view` displays last 20 audit events with optional `--from <date>` filter; `$audit export` writes unique timestamped export files (idempotent per session)
- `audit-export.skill.md` — namespace router for `$audit export` sub-command
- Opt-in via `modes/cocoaudit.on` sentinel file; created during `$pod init` when developer selects audit mode
- `post-tool-use.js` Section 6: appends ISO 8601 UTC timestamped records to `lifecycle/audit.md` using `fs.appendFileSync` exclusively — never read-modify-write
- `session-end.js` Section 3b: auto-commits `audit.md` with `chore(cocoaudit): append session audit record [timestamp]`
- `pod-init.skill.md` extended: prompts "Enable session audit trail?" and creates `modes/cocoaudit.on` + `lifecycle/audit.md` with project header block

#### CocoTrace — Artifact Traceability Graph (Feature 41)
- `cocotrace.skill.md` — `$trace build` runs SHA-256 scan and commits `lifecycle/trace.json`; `$trace gaps` reports orphaned requirements and uncovered code; `$trace show <artifact>` renders ASCII upstream/downstream chain
- `scripts/trace-check.js` — deterministic SHA-256 content-hash scanner; staleness propagates downstream via iterative edge traversal; no LLM; outputs "OK" or "STALE:node1,node2"; exits gracefully on missing state
- `session-start.js` Section 5: spawns `trace-check.js` as Tier 2 async check; writes advisory to stderr if any artifact is STALE; non-fatal on failure

#### CocoSketch — Visual Diagram Generation (Feature 42)
- `cocosketch.skill.md` — seven-step draw.io pipeline for `$sketch schema`, `$sketch flow`, `$sketch deps`; validates XML before Step 5; no `-e` for preview PNG; `-e` for final PNG; repairs IEND after Step 7; fallback chain to Mermaid
- `scripts/sketch-validate.js` — deterministic draw.io XML lint; checks `mxGraphModel` root, closing tag, required cells (id="0", id="1"), duplicate ids, orphaned edge references; exit 0=PASS, exit 1=FAIL
- `scripts/sketch-autolayout.js` — Kahn's algorithm topological sort; LR level assignment; NODE_W=120, NODE_H=60, H_GAP=50, V_GAP=40, MARGIN=30; used for >15 nodes
- `scripts/sketch-repair.js` — restores truncated PNG IEND chunk from draw.io `-e` exports; finds last IEND marker, verifies 12-byte chunk integrity, repairs from chunk start with complete IEND_CHUNK buffer
- Built-in style presets: `default.json` (blue palette, orthogonal, LR), `corporate.json` (greyscale, bold, TB), `handdrawn.json` (rough/sketchy, LR)

### Updated

#### CocoBehavior — Boy Scout Rule (Feature 22 Enhancement)
- `SKILL.md` v1.1.1: Constraint 5 added — Boy Scout Rule; one 66-rule violation per code-touch with mandatory rule-number citation (`"G25 applied: [what changed]"`); 66-rule reference table for Cortex code (F1, F3, G25, G36, N7, T9); "five constraints" in closing paragraph

#### CocoReview — Phase 5 Clean Code Enforcement (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md`: Step 7b added — Phase 5 scans Categories C, F, G, N, T with mandatory rule-number citations; YAML finding format with `phase`, `rule`, `severity`, `finding`, `file`, `line`; mandatory praise invariant; Exit Criteria updated to require Phase 5 praise finding
- `skills/cocoreview/clean-code.md` (new): 66-rule taxonomy reference guide with Cortex/Snowflake violation examples for all categories (C1–C5, E1–E3, F1–F4, G1–G36, N1–N7, T1–T9); Phase 5 review protocol with finding format

#### CocoSentinel — Dimension H Clean Code Gate (Feature 36 Enhancement)
- `sentinel.skill.md` v1.1.1: eight dimensions (A1–F, H); Dimension H FAIL overrides all others to BLOCKED; Step 7 spawns 8 parallel agents; Step 9 verdict logic updated with H-override rule; report template includes H row
- `sentinel-h.agent.md` (new): Dimension H — Clean Code (66-Rule Taxonomy); FAIL on structural violations (G5, G22, G31, N7 at cross-file scope); mandatory praise in every output; OVERRIDE_NOTE field when FAIL

#### CocoDiscuss — Red-Team Mode (Feature 30 Enhancement)
- `discuss.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--red-team` flag documented; post-PASS trigger for red-team session; non-blocking advisory
- `red-team.skill.md` (new): adversarial challenge session against all six `discuss.md` decision dimensions; per-challenge Risk Level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH); report written to `lifecycle/discuss-red-team.md` (append-only); never blocks `$plan`

#### CocoScout — Three-Tier Latency Contract (Feature 24 Enhancement)
- `SKILL.md` v1.1.0: Three-Tier Latency Contract table documented (Tier 1 <50ms inline, Tier 2 <5s async, Tier 3 batch/off-cycle); Tier 2 invariant: CocoScout must not block `UserPromptSubmit` hook return
- `user-prompt-submit.js`: Tier 1/2/3 contract documented in file header; Tier 1 SLA breach logging at >50ms; Tier 2 `spawnCocoScout()` via `execFile` fire-and-forget; persona routing sets `routed` flag to suppress scout spawn

#### CocoMap — Transitive Reduction (Feature 28 Enhancement)
- `map.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--reduce` / `--reduce off` flags; Step 7 runs `map-reduce.js` before merge; `structural.reduction` field in `coco-map.json`; anti-rationalization updated
- `scripts/map-reduce.js` (new): standard transitive reduction; O(V×E) BFS reachability; no LLM; atomic output write; outputs `removed_edges`, `reduction_stats`

#### CocoWisdom — Carry-Forward Thesis (Feature 37 Enhancement)
- `wisdom-insights.skill.md` v1.1.0: Step 1 loads prior thesis from most recent `insights-*.md`; Haiku mandate updated with carry-forward rule (prior thesis verbatim + `### New Evidence` subsection); insights file template includes `## Thesis` section; same-day file collision produces timestamped filename

#### CocoOps — Longitudinal Thesis (Feature 39 Enhancement)
- `ops-dora.skill.md` v1.1.0: Step 5b spawns `ops-thesis-updater.js` async after commit; `dora-thesis.md` committed if changed
- `scripts/ops-thesis-updater.js` (new): deterministic carry-forward thesis writer; reads `dora-snapshot.json`, appends dated evidence block to `dora-thesis.md`; never overwrites prior content

#### CocoPull — Two Output Modes (Feature 35 Enhancement)
- `pull.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--human` flag produces `<target>.pull-human.md` — prose narrative for stakeholder consumption; not used by CocoHarvest; never overwrites machine `.pull.md`; Sonnet subagent with inverted-pyramid structure, 500-word cap, plain language constraint

---

## [1.1.0] — May 2026

### Added

#### CocoSentinel — Eight-Dimension Artifact Quality Gate (Feature 36)
- `sentinel.skill.md` — `$sentinel <file>` evaluates any artifact across eight dimensions: Security Attack Surface (A1), Defensive Posture (A2), Correctness (B), Performance (C), Maintainability (D), Test Coverage (E), Compliance (F), and Reward Hacking Resistance (G); Dimension G evidence pre-gate runs deterministically before any LLM work
- `sentinel-approve.skill.md` — `$sentinel approve` records SHA-256-bound approval for a CONDITIONAL artifact; approval is invalidated if the artifact changes
- `sentinel-report.skill.md` — `$sentinel --report` displays full evaluation history with outcomes and approval status per artifact
- `scripts/sentinel-pregate.js` — Dimension G binary PASS/FAIL in <50ms; evaluates 4 evidence criteria (consistent estimate, tool calls, test coverage signal, completion marker) and 3 reward hacking signals (threshold fabrication, coverage inflation, self-congratulation patterns); no LLM
- Seven parallel dimension agents: `sentinel-a1.agent.md` (Security Attack Surface), `sentinel-a2.agent.md` (Defensive Posture), `sentinel-b.agent.md` (Correctness), `sentinel-c.agent.md` (Performance), `sentinel-d.agent.md` (Maintainability), `sentinel-e.agent.md` (Test Coverage), `sentinel-f.agent.md` (Compliance)
- Lock file discipline: `active-evaluation.lock` prevents concurrent sentinel runs; stale lock cleanup (>10 min) in `subagent-stop.js`

#### CocoWisdom — Institutional Memory for Rejections (Feature 37)
- `wisdom.skill.md` — `$wisdom <file>` primes critics with prior rejection context before evaluation; reads `rejections.jsonl` to surface relevant past failures
- `wisdom-list.skill.md` — `$wisdom list` browses rejection records with optional `--gate`, `--since`, `--dimension` filters
- `wisdom-search.skill.md` — `$wisdom search "<pattern>"` full-text case-insensitive search across rejection reason, dimension, and gate fields
- `wisdom-insights.skill.md` — `$wisdom insights` produces a Haiku-synthesized pattern report from the rejection history
- `scripts/wisdom-writer.js` — append-only `rejections.jsonl` writer; auto-increments record IDs; lock file inside try block ensuring cleanup on any error path

#### CocoReview — Structured Code Review (Feature 38)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` — `$review <file>` progressive-disclosure code review; four phases: context gathering, high-level architecture, line-by-line, verdict; six-severity vocabulary: `blocking`, `important`, `nit`, `suggestion`, `learning`, `praise`; `praise` finding structurally mandatory in every review
- `scripts/pr-complexity.js` — deterministic PR complexity analyzer; computes `size_bucket` (XS/S/M/L/XL) and complexity score; XL artifacts (≥800 lines changed) trigger split recommendation; `fileCount` uses only `diff --git` lines; `nonTestChanges` uses subtraction without erroneous factor of 2
- `skills/cocoreview/universal-quality.md` — nine universal anti-pattern baseline applied before any language guide
- `skills/cocoreview/language-sql.md` — SQL-specific review guide
- `skills/cocoreview/security-review.md` — security review guide with five-tier severity scale
- `skills/cocoreview/architecture-review.md` — architecture review guide
- Review output committed to `.cocoplus/review/cocoreview-<timestamp>.md` with `docs(review):` commit type

#### CocoOps — Delivery Intelligence Dashboard (Feature 39)
- `cocoops.skill.md` — `$ops` dispatcher routing to DORA, sprint, suggest, and demo sub-commands
- `ops-dora.skill.md` — `$ops dora` computes four DORA-adapted metrics (Pipeline Run Frequency, Data Availability Lead, Failure Recovery Time, Data Quality Failure Rate); idempotent commit via `git diff --quiet`
- `ops-sprint.skill.md` — `$ops sprint` computes velocity, burndown, and completion prediction from git log within sprint window; daily burn rate and projected final velocity; idempotent commit
- `ops-demo.skill.md` — `$ops demo` activates demo mode with 4-pipeline synthetic dataset for evaluation; `--off` deactivates; `--reset` clears demo data
- `scripts/dora-metrics.js` — deterministic DORA computation; reads Snowflake task history and git log; uses `path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'cocoplus.toml')` for config; exits 0 with message when `.cocoplus/` absent
- `scripts/ops-suggest.js` — time-aware operational suggestion classifier; reads `dora-snapshot.json` for data-cited suggestions

#### CocoPlus Config — SSOT Sync (Phase 26 Extension)
- `cocoplus-config.skill.md` — `$cocoplus sync` propagates `cocoplus.toml` into `security-rules.json` and other derived config files; `$cocoplus migrate-config` converts legacy `safety-config.json` to `cocoplus.toml` format
- `templates/cocoplus.toml.template` — canonical single-source config with `[project]`, `[security]`, `[warehouses]`, `[cost]`, `[sprint]`, `[review.rules]`, and `[demo]` sections

### Updated

#### CocoFlow — Dual Synthesis Fallback (Phase 26 Extension)
- `flow-run.skill.md` — synthesis stages fall back to rule-based script on LLM failure via `--input` flag convention; execution stages still fail hard; prevents silent data loss on LLM synthesis timeout

#### SecondEye — Six-Severity Vocabulary (Phase 26 Extension)
- `secondeye.skill.md` — all five critic prompts extended with six-severity labels (`blocking`, `important`, `nit`, `suggestion`, `learning`, `praise`); `severity_counts` added to `action_summary`; report sections reorganized to Blocking/Important/Nits/Praise; praise structurally enforced — missing praise terminates with error
- `secondeye-critic.agent.md` — added `version`, `author`, `tags` frontmatter; `Severity` field added to output format

#### Safety Gate — Four-Tier Boundary Framework (Phase 26 Extension)
- `pre-tool-use.js` — Four-Tier Boundary Framework added (Absolute, Configurable, Advisory, Transparent); comment corrected from "EHRB still runs regardless" to "all checks including EHRB are bypassed" to match actual code behavior

#### Session Lifecycle — Archetypes and Index (Phase 26 Extension)
- `scripts/archetype-classifier.js` — classifies sessions into 5 archetypes (Explorer, Builder, Reviewer, Debugger, Planner) from turn count, duration, and tool use patterns
- `scripts/session-indexer.js` — rebuild/append modes; exits 0 (not 1) when `.cocoplus/` absent; used by `session-end.js` for cross-session FTS5 index

#### CocoBloom — Crystallized Skill Output Path (Phase 26 Extension)
- `bloom-crystallize.skill.md` — output path corrected from `.cocoplus/skills/` (runtime state) to `.cortex/skills/crystallized/` (cortex artifacts)

#### CocoPull — Full-Text Search (Phase 26 Extension)
- `pull-search.skill.md` — `$pull search "<query>"` searches distilled pull files via FTS5 index built by `session-indexer.js`

### Fixed

- `wisdom-writer.js` — lock file creation moved inside `try` block; previously a throw from `nextRecordId()` would strand the lock file permanently
- `session-end.js` — meter data captured into local variables before `fs.unlinkSync(meterFile)` call; previously the deleted file was re-read in step 3, producing zero-duration and zero-turn index entries
- `subagent-stop.js` — stale lock cleanup replaces dead-code sentinel-synthesis ID check; lock older than 10 minutes is removed as safety net
- `pr-complexity.js` — `fileCount` now counts only `diff --git` header lines (not `+++` lines which caused ~2× overcount); `nonTestChanges` removes erroneous `* 2` multiplier that could produce negative values; `Math.max(0, ...)` guard added
- `dora-metrics.js` — `.cocoplus/` existence check added at start of `main()`; `cocoplus.toml` read via `path.resolve(process.cwd(), ...)` to work from any working directory
- `session-indexer.js` — exits with code 0 (not 1) when `.cocoplus/` is absent; absence is not an error condition
- `sentinel.skill.md` — step number in "wait before proceeding" corrected from Step 7 to Step 8
- `ops-dora.skill.md`, `ops-sprint.skill.md` — idempotency check added; `git diff --quiet` skips commit when snapshot unchanged
- `cocoreview.skill.md` — commit type corrected from `feat(review):` to `docs(review):`
- All seven sentinel dimension agents and `secondeye-critic.agent.md` — added missing `version`, `author`, `tags` frontmatter fields
- `wisdom.skill.md`, `wisdom-list.skill.md`, `wisdom-search.skill.md`, `sentinel-report.skill.md` — Anti-Rationalization tables added

---

## [1.0.3] — May 2026

### Updated

#### CocoBrew — Spec Phase (Feature 1)
- `cocobrew/spec.skill.md` — added Vague Language Detector: deterministic pattern scan across 6 term categories (performance, quality, scale, safety, UX, cost) before writing spec.md; up to −3 point CocoSpec penalty per vague instance; developer offered chance to refine answers before spec is committed; version 1.0.3

#### SecondEye — Devil's Advocate Fourth Lens (Feature 19)
- `secondeye/secondeye.skill.md` — added fourth parallel critic (Sonnet-tier Devil's Advocate); adversarial mandate to find strongest argument plan should not proceed; all DA findings BLOCKING by default; rebuttal scoring (1–5) required before concession — score <4 re-asserts; DA section sorted to top of report; `da_finding_count` added to `action_summary`; version 1.0.3

## [1.0.2] — May 2026

### Added

#### CocoHealth — Context Utilization Monitor (Feature 27)
- `pod-checkpoint.skill.md` — `$pod checkpoint` writes a structured recovery snapshot to `lifecycle/checkpoint.md`; captures current phase, in-progress flow stage, last 5 decisions, open must-fix items, HITL stages awaiting approval, active CocoHarvest harvest status, and triggered seeds; includes Context Window Recovery Decision Matrix recommendation when context is at/near 70% utilization

#### CocoMap — Cortex Function Knowledge Graph (Feature 28)
- `map.skill.md` — `$map` triggers a 5-agent parallel analysis pipeline (Function Scanner, Dependency Mapper, Domain Analyzer, Evaluation Mapper, Gap Detector); agents write intermediate results to `.cocoplus/map/intermediate/` without returning to orchestrator context; merges into committed `coco-map.json` with structural dependency graph and domain intent map; creates git commit
- `map-diff.skill.md` — `$map diff` reads staged git changes and `coco-map.json` to trace downstream impact of modified functions before commit lands; shows affected dependents, shared evaluation sets, and capability definitions
- `map-explain.skill.md` — `$map explain <target>` produces natural-language explanation of a specific function, business capability, or vocabulary term from the committed knowledge graph

#### CocoSeed — Deferred Ideas with Trigger Conditions (Feature 29)
- `seed-add.skill.md` — `$seed add "<idea>" --trigger "<condition>"` stores a forward-looking idea with a trigger condition as a YAML file in `.cocoplus/seeds/`; captures current lifecycle phase for context
- `seed-list.skill.md` — `$seed list` evaluates all pending seed trigger conditions against current project state (filesystem, lifecycle phase, mode flags); updates `status: triggered` for newly-fired seeds; displays Ready to Promote and Waiting sections
- `seed-promote.skill.md` — `$seed promote <id>` moves a triggered seed into `lifecycle/spec.md` under a Backlog Items section; marks seed as `status: promoted`

#### CocoDiscuss — Decision-Locking Pre-Plan Phase (Feature 30)
- `discuss.skill.md` — `$discuss` runs a structured wizard capturing model selection, evaluation methodology, accuracy threshold, warehouse assignment, production safety requirements, and scope boundaries into `lifecycle/discuss.md`; adapts questions to work type (AI function, Cortex Search, semantic model); auto-skips questions answered by CocoContext organizational standards; includes CocoSpec 5-dimension quality scoring gate (0–10, required ≥9) with Quick Mode bypass (skips Plan phase when score ≥9, scope ≤3 files, no EHRB indicators)

#### CocoGrove — Ubiquitous Language Section (Feature 12 improvement)
- `grove-glossary.skill.md` — `$grove glossary` scans project artifacts for domain vocabulary candidates and proposes additions to `.cocoplus/grove/language/glossary.md`; developer reviews and confirms each term before writing; creates git commit for accepted entries
- `grove-glossary-view.skill.md` — `$grove glossary view` displays the current glossary in alphabetical order with definitions, aliases, and associated functions

#### CocoPod — Project Knowledge Base (Feature 5 improvement)
- `pod-kb.skill.md` — `$pod kb` displays `lifecycle/kb.md` — the project-specific knowledge base populated by CocoCupper with Patterns, Decisions, and Gotchas across sessions; shows entry count by section and last update date

### Updated (Existing Features)

#### CocoBrew — Review Phase (Feature 1)
- `review.skill.md` — Decision Coverage Gate added: extracts key decisions from `plan.md` and `discuss.md`, scans implementation artifacts for evidence each decision is honored, flags Coverage Gaps as must-fix severity that block `$ship` until resolved or acknowledged with documented rationale

#### CocoBrew — Plan Phase (Feature 1 / Feature 30)
- `plan.skill.md` — CocoSpec pre-flight quality gate added as mandatory pre-plan step; spawns background Haiku scorer against 5 dimensions (Value, Scope, Acceptance, Boundaries, Risk) with 0–2 scoring; score ≥9 required; Quick Mode offered when score ≥9 + scope ≤3 files + no EHRB indicators; discuss.md is read and its decisions reflected in plan.md

#### CocoHarvest (Feature 3)
- `cocoharvest.skill.md` — added: CocoLens HITL/AFK classification per stage at decomposition time with developer override; Enhancement G adaptive parallelism (Normal → Caution → Single-track concurrency modes based on SubagentStop failure signals); stall detection by output token rate (threshold: 150 tokens/step, 5-step minimum, re-prompt before escalation); shell identity injection (COCOPLUS_FUNCTION, COCOPLUS_PERSONA, COCOPLUS_EVAL_ID, COCOPLUS_HARVEST_ID); consecutive failure escalation after 3 hard failures (configurable per stage); dual-file state initialization (`harvest/[run-id]-progress.txt` + `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json`) for context-reset recovery

#### CocoFlow — Execution Engine (Feature 6)
- `flow-run.skill.md` — added: `--concurrency <normal|caution|single-track>` flag to force concurrency mode for a run; dual-file state recovery on resume (reads `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json` to skip already-completed stages); intermediate result persistence for parallel evaluation stages (detailed results to `.cocoplus/harvest/intermediate/`, only summaries return to orchestrator); HITL stage pausing with developer review before downstream stages spawn; consecutive failure tracking with escalation at threshold
- `flow-status.skill.md` — added Concurrency Mode field showing current mode and last transition trigger event; added HITL column to stage status table

#### Safety Gate (Feature 9)
- `pre-tool-use.js` — added Prompt Injection Defense: structural anomaly scan on planning artifact reads (injection-type pattern detection, including base64-encoded content), logged to `safety-audit.jsonl`; added EHRB (Elevated-Hazard Requiring Buy-in) classification for SnowflakeSqlExecute calls, covering 5 categories (Production systems, Sensitive/PII, Destructive operations, Billing-significant, Security-critical); EHRB fires before Layer 1 hard gate and surfaces confirmation warning; EHRB billing threshold configurable in `safety-config.json`; execution order: injection scan → EHRB → Layer 1

#### SecondEye (Feature 19)
- `secondeye.skill.md` — added HITL/AFK classification per finding (HITL for Critical, architectural, or ambiguous findings; AFK for fix-pattern-mapped findings); added BLOCKING/MINOR classification (BLOCKING for correctness/security/architectural scope; MINOR for style/naming/non-critical coverage); report frontmatter gains `action_summary` with `hitl_count`, `afk_count`, `blocking_count`, `minor_count`
- `secondeye-acknowledge.skill.md` — added `--hitl-only` flag (acknowledge only HITL-classified findings; queue AFK for autonomous resolution) and `--blocking-only` flag (acknowledge only BLOCKING-classified findings; queue MINOR for autonomous resolution)

#### CocoScout (Feature 24)
- `cocoscout/SKILL.md` — added Two-Lens Relevance Ranking: Technical relevance (implementation approach) and Domain relevance (business intent), combined as weighted composite per persona type (DE/DS/AE: 70/30 technical/domain; DA/BI: 40/60; DPM/DST/CDO: 20/80); weights configurable in `plugin.json` under `cocoScout.weights`; added Anchor Lens: pre-compiled methodology vocabulary catalog at `grove/anchors/catalog.md`, pattern-matched against task message (<50ms, no LLM call), injects anchor names into build agent context preamble; per-persona anchor weighting; added `lifecycle/kb.md` as always-loaded low-tier context source for Build phase tasks; added CocoGrove glossary as context source ranked by term overlap

#### CocoPod — Status (Feature 5)
- `pod-status.skill.md` — added Project KB entry count to Section 6 (CocoGrove): shows "Project KB: N entries" or "Project KB: not yet populated"

### Notes
- Feature 31 (CocoLens) is integrated into CocoHarvest decomposition as a behavioral enhancement to `cocoharvest.skill.md` — no separate skill file required; HITL/AFK classification is applied automatically during plan decomposition with developer override available before spawning

## [1.0.1] — April 2026

### Added

#### CocoView — Flow Visualizer (Feature 20)
- `flow-view.skill.md` — `$flow view` renders `flow.json` as an interactive HTML DAG; injects pipeline data into `flow-view.html.template` and opens in the default browser; `--output <path>` writes to a custom path without opening the browser

#### CocoMeter Enhanced — Token Attribution & Dashboard (Feature 21)
- `meter-view.skill.md` — `$meter view` queries `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_CODE_CLI_USAGE_HISTORY` (two-pass query for direct and subagent-anchor request IDs), joins with local `request-map.jsonl` attribution data, injects into `meter-view.html.template`, and opens in browser
- `meter-sync.skill.md` — `$meter sync` refreshes the dashboard with updated Snowflake data without reopening the browser; intended for use after the 90-minute usage history latency window
- Updated `post-tool-use.js` — Section 5 captures `request_id` from every Snowflake tool result when CocoMeter is active, appending to `.cocoplus/meter/request-map.jsonl` with `stage_id`, `persona`, `tool_name`, `session_id`, and `timestamp` for per-stage attribution

#### CocoContext — Organizational Standards Capture (Feature 23)
- `context-add.skill.md` — `$context add` guided wizard captures org standards into `.cocoplus/context/<category>.md`; six categories: approved-models, quality-thresholds, pii-policy, warehouse-policy, naming-conventions, governance-gates; enforces ≤200 line limit; auto-commits with `feat(context):` message
- `context-view.skill.md` — `$context view [name]` displays a context file with line count and last-modified date
- `context-list.skill.md` — `$context list` shows all six standard slots with status (line count, date, or "not created")

#### CocoRecipe — Pre-Built Pipeline Templates (Feature 25)
- `recipe-list.skill.md` — `$recipe list` enumerates all templates from profile `recipes/` folder and project-local `.cocoplus/recipes/`
- `recipe-use.skill.md` — `$recipe use <name>` collects `{{param}}` values interactively, validates generated JSON against CocoFlow schema, writes to `.cocoplus/flow.json`
- `recipe-new.skill.md` — `$recipe new <name>` saves the current `flow.json` as a parameterized template in the profile `recipes/` folder

#### CocoDream — Supervised Pattern Distillation (Feature 26)
- `dream.skill.md` — `$dream` distils prompt iteration patterns from `.cocoplus/prompts/` histories (requires ≥3 versions per function); launches CocoCupper to cluster worked-patterns, anti-patterns, and neutral changes; writes candidates to `.cocoplus/grove/dream-<timestamp>.md` for developer review
- `dream-history.skill.md` — `$dream history [n]` lists past distillation sessions newest-first with function count and candidate breakdown

#### CocoBehavior — Ambient Behavioral Constraints (Feature 22)
- `cocobehavior/SKILL.md` — ambient constraint layer (`user_invocable: false`) loaded into all persona agents at startup; four constraints: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Scope Discipline, Goal-Driven

#### CocoScout — Relevance-Ranked Context Loading (Feature 24)
- `cocoscout/SKILL.md` — ambient context ranker (`user_invocable: false`) fires before every persona invocation and build stage; scores CocoGrove patterns, CocoContext files, environment snapshots, and prompt history by keyword relevance; prepends top-ranked context; completes in <5 seconds
- Registered `coco-scout` agent in `plugin.json`

### Fixed
- Registered the background `environment-inspector` and `quality-advisor` agents in `plugin.json` so hook-triggered automation has valid runtime targets
- Added runtime definitions for `environment-inspector` and `quality-advisor` background agents to match documented CocoPlus behavior
- Updated `post-tool-use.js` to queue and trigger background quality review after SQL writes when Quality mode is enabled
- Corrected `CocoCupper` and `SecondEye Critic` agent tool contracts so their allowed write targets match their documented outputs

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/features.html` — added Features 20–26 with full descriptions and "When to Use" guidance; updated feature count from 19 to 26
- Updated `docs/command-reference.html` — added command reference sections for CocoView, CocoMeter Enhanced, CocoContext, CocoRecipe, and CocoDream; updated PostToolUse hook description to include request_id capture
- Updated `docs/index.html` — added Features 20–26 to the feature overview table
- Updated `AGENTS.md` — listed all new features and commands
- Updated HTML documentation to align hook behavior, background agent behavior, and constrained-write agent semantics with the implementation
- Added `scripts/validate-cocoplus.js` to validate manifest-to-agent consistency, hook-spawned agent registration, and agent write-contract accuracy
