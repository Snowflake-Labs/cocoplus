---

## [1.0.2] — May 2026

### Added

#### CocoHealth — Context Utilization Monitor (Feature 27)
- `pod-checkpoint.skill.md` — `$pod checkpoint` writes a structured recovery snapshot to `lifecycle/checkpoint.md`; captures current phase, in-progress flow stage, last 5 decisions, open must-fix items, HITL stages awaiting approval, active CocoHarvest harvest status, and triggered seeds; includes Context Window Recovery Decision Matrix recommendation when context is at/near 70% utilization

#### CocoMap — Cortex Function Knowledge Graph (Feature 28)
- `map.skill.md` — `$map` triggers a 5-agent parallel analysis pipeline (Function Scanner, Dependency Mapper, Domain Analyzer, Evaluation Mapper, Gap Detector); agents write intermediate results to `.cocoplus/map/intermediate/` without returning to orchestrator context; merges into committed `coco-map.json` with structural dependency graph and domain intent map; creates git commit
- `map-diff.skill.md` — `$map diff` reads staged git changes and `coco-map.json` to trace downstream impact of modified functions before commit lands; shows affected dependents, shared evaluation sets, and capability definitions
- `map-explain.skill.md` — `$map explain <target>` produces natural-language explanation of a specific function, business capability, or vocabulary term from the committed knowledge graph

#### CocoSeed — Deferred Ideas with Trigger Conditions (Feature 29)
- `seed-add.skill.md` — `$seed add "<idea>" --trigger "<condition>"` stores a forward-looking idea with a trigger condition as a YAML file in `.cocoplus/seeds/`; captures current lifecycle phase for context
- `seed-list.skill.md` — `$seed list` evaluates all pending seed trigger conditions against current project state (filesystem, lifecycle phase, mode flags); updates `status: triggered` for newly-fired seeds; displays Ready to Promote and Waiting sections
- `seed-promote.skill.md` — `$seed promote <id>` moves a triggered seed into `lifecycle/spec.md` under a Backlog Items section; marks seed as `status: promoted`

#### CocoDiscuss — Decision-Locking Pre-Plan Phase (Feature 30)
- `discuss.skill.md` — `$discuss` runs a structured wizard capturing model selection, evaluation methodology, accuracy threshold, warehouse assignment, production safety requirements, and scope boundaries into `lifecycle/discuss.md`; adapts questions to work type (AI function, Cortex Search, semantic model); auto-skips questions answered by CocoContext organizational standards; includes CocoSpec 5-dimension quality scoring gate (0–10, required ≥9) with Quick Mode bypass (skips Plan phase when score ≥9, scope ≤3 files, no EHRB indicators)

#### CocoGrove — Ubiquitous Language Section (Feature 12 improvement)
- `grove-glossary.skill.md` — `$grove glossary` scans project artifacts for domain vocabulary candidates and proposes additions to `.cocoplus/grove/language/glossary.md`; developer reviews and confirms each term before writing; creates git commit for accepted entries
- `grove-glossary-view.skill.md` — `$grove glossary view` displays the current glossary in alphabetical order with definitions, aliases, and associated functions

#### CocoPod — Project Knowledge Base (Feature 5 improvement)
- `pod-kb.skill.md` — `$pod kb` displays `lifecycle/kb.md` — the project-specific knowledge base populated by CocoCupper with Patterns, Decisions, and Gotchas across sessions; shows entry count by section and last update date

### Updated (Existing Features)

#### CocoBrew — Review Phase (Feature 1)
- `review.skill.md` — Decision Coverage Gate added: extracts key decisions from `plan.md` and `discuss.md`, scans implementation artifacts for evidence each decision is honored, flags Coverage Gaps as must-fix severity that block `$ship` until resolved or acknowledged with documented rationale

#### CocoBrew — Plan Phase (Feature 1 / Feature 30)
- `plan.skill.md` — CocoSpec pre-flight quality gate added as mandatory pre-plan step; spawns background Haiku scorer against 5 dimensions (Value, Scope, Acceptance, Boundaries, Risk) with 0–2 scoring; score ≥9 required; Quick Mode offered when score ≥9 + scope ≤3 files + no EHRB indicators; discuss.md is read and its decisions reflected in plan.md

#### CocoHarvest (Feature 3)
- `cocoharvest.skill.md` — added: CocoLens HITL/AFK classification per stage at decomposition time with developer override; Enhancement G adaptive parallelism (Normal → Caution → Single-track concurrency modes based on SubagentStop failure signals); stall detection by output token rate (threshold: 150 tokens/step, 5-step minimum, re-prompt before escalation); shell identity injection (COCOPLUS_FUNCTION, COCOPLUS_PERSONA, COCOPLUS_EVAL_ID, COCOPLUS_HARVEST_ID); consecutive failure escalation after 3 hard failures (configurable per stage); dual-file state initialization (`harvest/[run-id]-progress.txt` + `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json`) for context-reset recovery

#### CocoFlow — Execution Engine (Feature 6)
- `flow-run.skill.md` — added: `--concurrency <normal|caution|single-track>` flag to force concurrency mode for a run; dual-file state recovery on resume (reads `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json` to skip already-completed stages); intermediate result persistence for parallel evaluation stages (detailed results to `.cocoplus/harvest/intermediate/`, only summaries return to orchestrator); HITL stage pausing with developer review before downstream stages spawn; consecutive failure tracking with escalation at threshold
- `flow-status.skill.md` — added Concurrency Mode field showing current mode and last transition trigger event; added HITL column to stage status table

#### Safety Gate (Feature 9)
- `pre-tool-use.js` — added Prompt Injection Defense: structural anomaly scan on planning artifact reads (injection-type pattern detection, including base64-encoded content), logged to `safety-audit.jsonl`; added EHRB (Elevated-Hazard Requiring Buy-in) classification for SnowflakeSqlExecute calls, covering 5 categories (Production systems, Sensitive/PII, Destructive operations, Billing-significant, Security-critical); EHRB fires before Layer 1 hard gate and surfaces confirmation warning; EHRB billing threshold configurable in `safety-config.json`; execution order: injection scan → EHRB → Layer 1

#### SecondEye (Feature 19)
- `secondeye.skill.md` — added HITL/AFK classification per finding (HITL for Critical, architectural, or ambiguous findings; AFK for fix-pattern-mapped findings); added BLOCKING/MINOR classification (BLOCKING for correctness/security/architectural scope; MINOR for style/naming/non-critical coverage); report frontmatter gains `action_summary` with `hitl_count`, `afk_count`, `blocking_count`, `minor_count`
- `secondeye-acknowledge.skill.md` — added `--hitl-only` flag (acknowledge only HITL-classified findings; queue AFK for autonomous resolution) and `--blocking-only` flag (acknowledge only BLOCKING-classified findings; queue MINOR for autonomous resolution)

#### CocoScout (Feature 24)
- `cocoscout/SKILL.md` — added Two-Lens Relevance Ranking: Technical relevance (implementation approach) and Domain relevance (business intent), combined as weighted composite per persona type (DE/DS/AE: 70/30 technical/domain; DA/BI: 40/60; DPM/DST/CDO: 20/80); weights configurable in `plugin.json` under `cocoScout.weights`; added Anchor Lens: pre-compiled methodology vocabulary catalog at `grove/anchors/catalog.md`, pattern-matched against task message (<50ms, no LLM call), injects anchor names into build agent context preamble; per-persona anchor weighting; added `lifecycle/kb.md` as always-loaded low-tier context source for Build phase tasks; added CocoGrove glossary as context source ranked by term overlap

#### CocoPod — Status (Feature 5)
- `pod-status.skill.md` — added Project KB entry count to Section 6 (CocoGrove): shows "Project KB: N entries" or "Project KB: not yet populated"

### Notes
- Feature 31 (CocoLens) is integrated into CocoHarvest decomposition as a behavioral enhancement to `cocoharvest.skill.md` — no separate skill file required; HITL/AFK classification is applied automatically during plan decomposition with developer override available before spawning

## [1.0.1] — April 2026

### Added

#### CocoView — Flow Visualizer (Feature 20)
- `flow-view.skill.md` — `$flow view` renders `flow.json` as an interactive HTML DAG; injects pipeline data into `flow-view.html.template` and opens in the default browser; `--output <path>` writes to a custom path without opening the browser

#### CocoMeter Enhanced — Token Attribution & Dashboard (Feature 21)
- `meter-view.skill.md` — `$meter view` queries `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_CODE_CLI_USAGE_HISTORY` (two-pass query for direct and subagent-anchor request IDs), joins with local `request-map.jsonl` attribution data, injects into `meter-view.html.template`, and opens in browser
- `meter-sync.skill.md` — `$meter sync` refreshes the dashboard with updated Snowflake data without reopening the browser; intended for use after the 90-minute usage history latency window
- Updated `post-tool-use.js` — Section 5 captures `request_id` from every Snowflake tool result when CocoMeter is active, appending to `.cocoplus/meter/request-map.jsonl` with `stage_id`, `persona`, `tool_name`, `session_id`, and `timestamp` for per-stage attribution

#### CocoContext — Organizational Standards Capture (Feature 23)
- `context-add.skill.md` — `$context add` guided wizard captures org standards into `.cocoplus/context/<category>.md`; six categories: approved-models, quality-thresholds, pii-policy, warehouse-policy, naming-conventions, governance-gates; enforces ≤200 line limit; auto-commits with `feat(context):` message
- `context-view.skill.md` — `$context view [name]` displays a context file with line count and last-modified date
- `context-list.skill.md` — `$context list` shows all six standard slots with status (line count, date, or "not created")

#### CocoRecipe — Pre-Built Pipeline Templates (Feature 25)
- `recipe-list.skill.md` — `$recipe list` enumerates all templates from profile `recipes/` folder and project-local `.cocoplus/recipes/`
- `recipe-use.skill.md` — `$recipe use <name>` collects `{{param}}` values interactively, validates generated JSON against CocoFlow schema, writes to `.cocoplus/flow.json`
- `recipe-new.skill.md` — `$recipe new <name>` saves the current `flow.json` as a parameterized template in the profile `recipes/` folder

#### CocoDream — Supervised Pattern Distillation (Feature 26)
- `dream.skill.md` — `$dream` distils prompt iteration patterns from `.cocoplus/prompts/` histories (requires ≥3 versions per function); launches CocoCupper to cluster worked-patterns, anti-patterns, and neutral changes; writes candidates to `.cocoplus/grove/dream-<timestamp>.md` for developer review
- `dream-history.skill.md` — `$dream history [n]` lists past distillation sessions newest-first with function count and candidate breakdown

#### CocoBehavior — Ambient Behavioral Constraints (Feature 22)
- `cocobehavior/SKILL.md` — ambient constraint layer (`user_invocable: false`) loaded into all persona agents at startup; four constraints: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Scope Discipline, Goal-Driven

#### CocoScout — Relevance-Ranked Context Loading (Feature 24)
- `cocoscout/SKILL.md` — ambient context ranker (`user_invocable: false`) fires before every persona invocation and build stage; scores CocoGrove patterns, CocoContext files, environment snapshots, and prompt history by keyword relevance; prepends top-ranked context; completes in <5 seconds
- Registered `coco-scout` agent in `plugin.json`

### Fixed
- Registered the background `environment-inspector` and `quality-advisor` agents in `plugin.json` so hook-triggered automation has valid runtime targets
- Added runtime definitions for `environment-inspector` and `quality-advisor` background agents to match documented CocoPlus behavior
- Updated `post-tool-use.js` to queue and trigger background quality review after SQL writes when Quality mode is enabled
- Corrected `CocoCupper` and `SecondEye Critic` agent tool contracts so their allowed write targets match their documented outputs

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/features.html` — added Features 20–26 with full descriptions and "When to Use" guidance; updated feature count from 19 to 26
- Updated `docs/command-reference.html` — added command reference sections for CocoView, CocoMeter Enhanced, CocoContext, CocoRecipe, and CocoDream; updated PostToolUse hook description to include request_id capture
- Updated `docs/index.html` — added Features 20–26 to the feature overview table
- Updated `AGENTS.md` — listed all new features and commands
- Updated HTML documentation to align hook behavior, background agent behavior, and constrained-write agent semantics with the implementation
- Added `scripts/validate-cocoplus.js` to validate manifest-to-agent consistency, hook-spawned agent registration, and agent write-contract accuracy
