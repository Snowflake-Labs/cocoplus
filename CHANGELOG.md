## [1.2.0] — July 2026

### Added

#### CocoPivot — Multi-Pod Convergence Synthesizer (Feature 47)
- `cococonverge/cococonverge.skill.md` — `$pivot run/run --since/show/status/clear`; deterministic three-pass deduplication (same file:line → same issue type in file → similar snippet), stable `PIVOT-NNN` finding IDs, priority/effort inheritance (highest/largest among contributing sources), PARTIAL-source transparency in `FINDINGS.md` header, scope anomaly detection against pod `excludes:` declarations
- `scripts/pivot-merge.js` — deterministic convergence engine, no LLM; reads `.cocoplus/pod-status.json`, writes `lifecycle/FINDINGS.md` (committed) and `lifecycle/findings-state.json` (gitignored)
- `scripts/status-envelope-check.js` — Tier 1 (<200ms) status envelope validator; validates `pod`/`status`/`timestamp`/`duration_seconds`/`findings_count` on every subagent completion; logs quality warnings without ever blocking
- `subagent-stop.js` extended: validates every subagent's status envelope (if present) before type-specific routing

#### CocoContract — Outcome-Driven Cortex Function Development (Feature 44)
- `cococontract/contract.skill.md` — `$contract init/check/prove/archive/ci/status`; declares a persona/observable-result/falsifiability-condition contract before `$spec` or `$build` is permitted; commits `outcomes/<function-name>/contract.md`
- `scripts/contract-prove.js` — records evidence at one of five tiers (e2e/reference/spec/differential/unit, strongest first) bound to the function's current source hash; `--ci` mode re-executes all archived contracts and exits non-zero on regression
- `scripts/contract-gate.js` — Tier 1, no LLM: blocks `$spec`/`$build` without a committed contract, blocks `$ship` without fresh e2e-or-reference evidence; no override flags exist
- `scripts/_contract-hash.js` — shared source-hash routine used by both prove and gate so evidence recording and staleness checking never diverge
- `user-prompt-submit.js` extended: calls `contract-gate.js` for `$spec`, `$build`, `$ship`

#### CocoRefine — Persistent Prompt Strategy Learning Loop (Feature 45)
- `cocorefine/refine.skill.md` — `$refine search/add/update/deprecate/history/status`; maintains the committed CocoStrategyBook at `cocoplus/strategies/`
- `scripts/refine-update.js` — atomic add/update/deprecate mutator; rejects hedging language; requires an evidence attribution record (never a self-authored justification); preserves full version history
- `scripts/refine-reflect.js` — Tier 3 async Reflect step; grounds attribution only in a matching CocoContract evidence record; produces no attribution when the record is missing or incomplete
- `subagent-stop.js` extended: queues evaluation subagent completions to `refine/pending.jsonl`, triggers `refine-reflect.js` at a queue threshold

#### CocoRecall — CocoPod Session History Retrieval (Feature 46)
- `cocorecall/recall.skill.md` — `$recall search/show/import/sources/status`; session-diverse retrieval with a mandatory four-field citation contract (session ID, turn ID, source-exists, suggested follow-up); retrieval-not-interpretation — verbatim excerpts only
- `scripts/recall-import.js` — local SQLite index (`.cocoplus/recall.db`, gitignored) over sessions/turns/entities/citations tables via Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (no native binary dependency); fails gracefully with a clear message on Node runtimes older than 22.5
- `cocoplus/recall-sources.json` — committed default source path config
- `session-end.js` extended: Tier 2 async `recall-import.js --since <session-start>`

### Updated

#### CocoFlow — Fan-out/Fan-in Primitives (Feature 6 Enhancement)
- `flow-run.skill.md` v1.2.0: `parallel:` step type (spawns N pods simultaneously; `on_partial:`/`on_error:` governance; `require_complete:` option) and `converge:` step type (fan-in; `handler: cococonverge` auto-invokes `$pivot run`); validator warning when a `parallel:` step has no subsequent `converge:` step
- `flow-status.skill.md` v1.1.0: per-pod completion table for `parallel:` steps, sourced from `pod-status.json`; `PARTIAL` always rendered distinctly from `COMPLETE`

#### CocoReview — BLOCKED Verdict (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` v1.4.0: fifth output state `BLOCKED` for findings requiring human judgment outside review authority — requires what-was-found, why-human-judgment-is-required, and options-as-understood; `$ship` treats `BLOCKED` identically to `blocking`
- `cocoreview/review-clear-blocked.skill.md` (new): `$review clear-blocked --id <finding-id> --rationale <text>` records rationale in the audit trail and resolves the finding in `review-state.json`
- `ship.skill.md` v1.1.0: `$ship` blocked by unresolved `BLOCKED` findings in `review-state.json`, with no override path

#### CocoReview — Effort Sizing and Priority Tiers (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` v1.4.0: every finding gains `priority:` (P1 pre-deploy / P2 this sprint / P3 this month / P4 backlog) and `effort:` (XS / S / M / L / XL) fields, orthogonal to severity; `XL` findings require explicit developer acknowledgment; CocoPivot inherits highest priority and largest effort when deduplicating across pods

#### CocoPod — Explicit Scope Exclusion (All Pods Enhancement)
- All 25 `.agent.md` definitions (8 specialist personas, 10 utility/orchestration agents, 8 CocoSentinel dimension reviewers) gain an `excludes:` frontmatter field declaring the concern classes each pod does not own
- `pod-init.skill.md`: warns when a pod is registered for `parallel:` use without an `excludes:` declaration; advisory, not blocking, for solo-pod workflows
- `pivot-merge.js` reads `excludes:` from each contributing pod's `.agent.md` at convergence time for scope anomaly detection

#### CocoFlow — PARTIAL Status Propagation (Feature 6 Enhancement)
- `pod-status.skill.md` v1.0.3→ (see Pod Completion Status section): `$pod status` renders `PARTIAL` pods distinctly, never merged into or displayed as `COMPLETE`, sourced from `pod-status.json`

#### CocoSpec — Mandatory Outcome Statement (Feature 15 Enhancement)
- `spec.skill.md` v1.0.4: pre-gate requires a "When this function works, [persona] sees [result]" statement with a named persona and non-implementation result before five-dimension scoring; rejects generic personas and implementation-phrased results; stored in `spec.md`

#### SecondEye — Shadow Rule Enforcement (Feature 10 Enhancement)
- `secondeye.skill.md` v1.2.0: `$secondeye shadow-add/shadow-report/shadow-promote`; shadow rules run parallel to active critics without affecting verdict, recording to `secondeye/shadow-findings.json` (gitignored)
- `scripts/shadow-report.js` — computes per-rule activation rate and developer-acceptance rate against promotion thresholds

#### CocoBehavior — L0–L3 Maturity Classification (Feature 22 Enhancement)
- `cocobehavior/behavior-maturity.skill.md` (new, `user-invocable: true`): `$behavior maturity` command; L0 (Manual) through L3 (Autonomous-Eligible) levels; L3 ten-item readiness checklist
- `cocobehavior/SKILL.md` v1.2.0: adds a short pointer to the new maturity command; the ambient constraint layer itself remains `user-invocable: false`
- `cocopod/pod-status.skill.md` v1.0.3: new Maturity Level section reads `.cocoplus/maturity.json` and surfaces the current level in `$pod status`
- `scripts/behavior-maturity.js` — deterministic level computation from `cocoplus.toml` and `.cocoplus/modes/`; writes `.cocoplus/maturity.json`

#### CocoReview — METR Rejection Taxonomy (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` v1.2.0: Phase 1 findings classified under code-quality/style/scope/collateral-effects/defensive-code; `blocking`/`important` findings require an `evidence_tier` citation (e2e/reference/project-historical) — unit/self-assessment evidence is capped at `nit`; scope/collateral/defensive findings require `requested_change` and `observed_delta` fields

#### CocoCupper — Automatic Correction Capture (Feature 8 Enhancement)
- `scripts/cupper-capture.js` — Tier 1 (fire-and-forget, <200ms budget), regex-based correction detection on every prompt; silent capture to `cupper/auto-captured.json` (gitignored)
- `user-prompt-submit.js` extended: spawns `cupper-capture.js` async on every non-command prompt
- `cup-history.skill.md` v1.1.0: `$cup history` surfaces auto-captured corrections alongside manual findings with incorrect-behavior/missing-variant/agent-misapplication routing

#### CocoGrove — Promotion Scoring (Feature 9 Enhancement)
- `patterns-promote.skill.md` v1.1.0: `$grove score <pattern-id>` — Durability × Impact × Scope (0–3 each); total ≥6 promotes, 4–5 watches, ≤3 ignores, any single dimension of 3 overrides toward review; three mandatory distillation rules (descriptive-to-prescriptive, verbose-to-concise, conditional-to-absolute) enforced before any convention entry is written
- `scripts/grove-score.js` — deterministic scoring and distillation-rule checker

#### CocoTrace — Blast Radius Precomputation (Feature 41 Enhancement)
- `cocotrace.skill.md` v1.1.0: `$trace blast <object>` and `$trace check --before-change` (informational, non-blocking, records to `lifecycle/audit.md`)
- `scripts/trace-blast.js` — reverse-index query over `snowflake-deps.json`; reports dependency type, traceability chain, and CocoContract evidence staleness per affected function
- `scripts/trace-check.js` extended: maintains `snowflake-deps.json` from `lifecycle/build/` artifacts as part of `$trace build`

#### CocoAudit — Outcome Contract Lifecycle Events (Feature 40 Enhancement)
- `cocoaudit.skill.md` v1.1.0: documents four CocoContract event categories (declaration, evidence submission, stale-evidence detection, archive); `$audit ci` promoted to run a contract regression phase before standard audit log verification
- `scripts/audit-ci.js` — runs `contract-prove.js --ci` then verifies audit log structural integrity; non-zero exit on either failure
- `post-tool-use.js` AUDIT_EVENTS extended with `contract-declared`, `contract-evidence-submitted`, `contract-evidence-stale`, `contract-archived`

#### CocoWisdom — Correction Routing (Feature 37 Enhancement)
- `wisdom.skill.md` v1.1.0: `$wisdom route` groups auto-captured corrections by skill context and proposes edits; no file is ever modified without explicit developer confirmation
- `scripts/wisdom-route.js` — deterministic first-pass grouping and classification

#### Plugin Manifest
- `plugin.json` v1.2.0: skills array gains `cococontract/contract`, `cocorefine/refine`, `cocorecall/recall`, `cococonverge/cococonverge`, and `cocoreview/review-clear-blocked`; scripts array gains sixteen new deterministic scripts for the above features and enhancements

---

## [1.1.1] — June 2026

### Added

#### CocoLean — Minimum Viable Cortex Surface (Feature 43)
- `cocolean/lean.skill.md` — `$lean`, `$lean lite`, `$lean full`, `$lean ultra` activate the six-rung Cortex-adapted decision ladder and set the intensity mode in `.cocoplus/modes/lean.mode`; intensity persists across sessions; three intensity levels: lite (ladder only), full (all modes, default), ultra (full + enforcement — contested Rung 1 requires explicit rationale before `$plan` proceeds)
- `cocolean/lean-review.skill.md` — `$lean review` invokes `lean-review.js` (deterministic, no LLM, Tier 1 latency) to scan the current git diff and apply five classification tags in severity order: `delete` (no callers, no tests, no spec reference), `yagni` (speculative abstractions), `stdlib` (reimplemented built-ins — includes replacement construct), `native` (AI function better expressed as native Snowflake object — includes recommended type), `shrink` (verbose single-operation implementation); carve-outs (trust boundaries, security controls, compliance) are always exempt
- `cocolean/lean-debt.skill.md` — `$lean debt` invokes `lean-debt.js` (deterministic harvest, Haiku narrative layer) to scan all `cocoplus:` markers across the CocoPod; each marker carries `simplified=`, `ceiling=`, `trigger=` fields; findings ranked by `ceiling_imminence × days_since_annotation`; report committed to `.cocoplus/lifecycle/lean-debt.md`
- `scripts/lean-review.js` — deterministic diff scanner; reads staged + unstaged git diff; applies stdlib/native/yagni/shrink/delete patterns via regex and AST matching; checks declared requirements in `spec.md` and `discuss.md` for yagni/delete classification; no LLM
- `scripts/lean-debt.js` — deterministic `cocoplus:` marker harvester; walks all project files; extracts three required fields; calculates ceiling imminence from project metrics (`dora-snapshot.json`, `flow.json`, seed count); ranks by `ceiling_imminence × days_since_annotation`; outputs JSON; LLM narrative is added by the skill layer

### Updated

#### CocoBehavior — Minimum Viable Function Ladder (Feature 22 Enhancement)
- `cocobehavior/SKILL.md` v1.2.0: Constraint 6 added — Minimum Viable Function Ladder; six-rung pre-build checklist embedded as compact constraint; fires before any tool call that creates a new Cortex function, stage handler, or subagent definition; advisory by default, enforcing in `$lean ultra` mode; carve-outs match CocoLean's non-negotiable exemptions; closing paragraph updated to "six constraints"; Exit Criteria updated from four to six

#### CocoReview — Phase 6 Complexity Audit (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` v1.2.0: Step 7c added — Phase 6 Complexity Audit; applies five CocoLean classification tags (`delete`/`stdlib`/`native`/`yagni`/`shrink`) to the Cortex function layer of the reviewed artifact; tag distribution summary (`delete:[N] stdlib:[N] native:[N] yagni:[N] shrink:[N]`) required in every report; mandatory `praise` finding when artifact shows complexity restraint; carve-outs match CocoLean exemptions; Phase 6 always runs (not routed by flags); output template updated with "Complexity Audit (Phase 6)" section; Exit Criteria updated to require Phase 6 tag distribution summary

#### Persona Agent Files — Character Backstories
- `data-engineer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — pipeline failure modes, upstream schema assumptions, contract between teams
- `analytics-engineer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — metric definition discipline, dashboard number disagreements
- `data-scientist.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — plausible-vs-correct distinction, evaluation metric as hypothesis
- `data-analyst.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — ad-hoc query documentation discipline, assumption capture
- `bi-analyst.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — dashboard usage decay, decision-enablement test before design
- `data-product-manager.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — specified-vs-needed gap, decision-enablement framing
- `data-steward.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — undocumented schema assumptions as organizational debt
- `chief-data-officer.agent.md`: **Background** paragraph added — organizational absorption rate, operationalizability over elegance

#### Plugin Manifest
- `plugin.json` v1.2.0: skills array gains `cocolean/lean`, `cocolean/lean-review`, `cocolean/lean-debt`; scripts array gains `scripts/lean-review.js`, `scripts/lean-debt.js`

## [1.1.1] — June 2026

### Added

#### CocoAudit — Session Audit Trail (Feature 40)
- `cocoaudit.skill.md` — `$audit view` displays last 20 audit events with optional `--from <date>` filter; `$audit export` writes unique timestamped export files (idempotent per session)
- `audit-export.skill.md` — namespace router for `$audit export` sub-command
- Opt-in via `modes/cocoaudit.on` sentinel file; created during `$pod init` when developer selects audit mode
- `post-tool-use.js` Section 6: appends ISO 8601 UTC timestamped records to `lifecycle/audit.md` using `fs.appendFileSync` exclusively — never read-modify-write
- `session-end.js` Section 3b: auto-commits `audit.md` with `chore(cocoaudit): append session audit record [timestamp]`
- `pod-init.skill.md` extended: prompts "Enable session audit trail?" and creates `modes/cocoaudit.on` + `lifecycle/audit.md` with project header block

#### CocoTrace — Artifact Traceability Graph (Feature 41)
- `cocotrace.skill.md` — `$trace build` runs SHA-256 scan and commits `lifecycle/trace.json`; `$trace gaps` reports orphaned requirements and uncovered code; `$trace show <artifact>` renders ASCII upstream/downstream chain
- `scripts/trace-check.js` — deterministic SHA-256 content-hash scanner; staleness propagates downstream via iterative edge traversal; no LLM; outputs "OK" or "STALE:node1,node2"; exits gracefully on missing state
- `session-start.js` Section 5: spawns `trace-check.js` as Tier 2 async check; writes advisory to stderr if any artifact is STALE; non-fatal on failure

#### CocoSketch — Visual Diagram Generation (Feature 42)
- `cocosketch.skill.md` — seven-step draw.io pipeline for `$sketch schema`, `$sketch flow`, `$sketch deps`; validates XML before Step 5; no `-e` for preview PNG; `-e` for final PNG; repairs IEND after Step 7; fallback chain to Mermaid
- `scripts/sketch-validate.js` — deterministic draw.io XML lint; checks `mxGraphModel` root, closing tag, required cells (id="0", id="1"), duplicate ids, orphaned edge references; exit 0=PASS, exit 1=FAIL
- `scripts/sketch-autolayout.js` — Kahn's algorithm topological sort; LR level assignment; NODE_W=120, NODE_H=60, H_GAP=50, V_GAP=40, MARGIN=30; used for >15 nodes
- `scripts/sketch-repair.js` — restores truncated PNG IEND chunk from draw.io `-e` exports; finds last IEND marker, verifies 12-byte chunk integrity, repairs from chunk start with complete IEND_CHUNK buffer
- Built-in style presets: `default.json` (blue palette, orthogonal, LR), `corporate.json` (greyscale, bold, TB), `handdrawn.json` (rough/sketchy, LR)

### Updated

#### CocoBehavior — Boy Scout Rule (Feature 22 Enhancement)
- `SKILL.md` v1.1.1: Constraint 5 added — Boy Scout Rule; one 66-rule violation per code-touch with mandatory rule-number citation (`"G25 applied: [what changed]"`); 66-rule reference table for Cortex code (F1, F3, G25, G36, N7, T9); "five constraints" in closing paragraph

#### CocoReview — Phase 5 Clean Code Enforcement (Feature 38 Enhancement)
- `cocoreview.skill.md`: Step 7b added — Phase 5 scans Categories C, F, G, N, T with mandatory rule-number citations; YAML finding format with `phase`, `rule`, `severity`, `finding`, `file`, `line`; mandatory praise invariant; Exit Criteria updated to require Phase 5 praise finding
- `skills/cocoreview/clean-code.md` (new): 66-rule taxonomy reference guide with Cortex/Snowflake violation examples for all categories (C1–C5, E1–E3, F1–F4, G1–G36, N1–N7, T1–T9); Phase 5 review protocol with finding format

#### CocoSentinel — Dimension H Clean Code Gate (Feature 36 Enhancement)
- `sentinel.skill.md` v1.1.1: eight dimensions (A1–F, H); Dimension H FAIL overrides all others to BLOCKED; Step 7 spawns 8 parallel agents; Step 9 verdict logic updated with H-override rule; report template includes H row
- `sentinel-h.agent.md` (new): Dimension H — Clean Code (66-Rule Taxonomy); FAIL on structural violations (G5, G22, G31, N7 at cross-file scope); mandatory praise in every output; OVERRIDE_NOTE field when FAIL

#### CocoDiscuss — Red-Team Mode (Feature 30 Enhancement)
- `discuss.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--red-team` flag documented; post-PASS trigger for red-team session; non-blocking advisory
- `red-team.skill.md` (new): adversarial challenge session against all six `discuss.md` decision dimensions; per-challenge Risk Level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH); report written to `lifecycle/discuss-red-team.md` (append-only); never blocks `$plan`

#### CocoScout — Three-Tier Latency Contract (Feature 24 Enhancement)
- `SKILL.md` v1.1.0: Three-Tier Latency Contract table documented (Tier 1 <50ms inline, Tier 2 <5s async, Tier 3 batch/off-cycle); Tier 2 invariant: CocoScout must not block `UserPromptSubmit` hook return
- `user-prompt-submit.js`: Tier 1/2/3 contract documented in file header; Tier 1 SLA breach logging at >50ms; Tier 2 `spawnCocoScout()` via `execFile` fire-and-forget; persona routing sets `routed` flag to suppress scout spawn

#### CocoMap — Transitive Reduction (Feature 28 Enhancement)
- `map.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--reduce` / `--reduce off` flags; Step 7 runs `map-reduce.js` before merge; `structural.reduction` field in `coco-map.json`; anti-rationalization updated
- `scripts/map-reduce.js` (new): standard transitive reduction; O(V×E) BFS reachability; no LLM; atomic output write; outputs `removed_edges`, `reduction_stats`

#### CocoWisdom — Carry-Forward Thesis (Feature 37 Enhancement)
- `wisdom-insights.skill.md` v1.1.0: Step 1 loads prior thesis from most recent `insights-*.md`; Haiku mandate updated with carry-forward rule (prior thesis verbatim + `### New Evidence` subsection); insights file template includes `## Thesis` section; same-day file collision produces timestamped filename

#### CocoOps — Longitudinal Thesis (Feature 39 Enhancement)
- `ops-dora.skill.md` v1.1.0: Step 5b spawns `ops-thesis-updater.js` async after commit; `dora-thesis.md` committed if changed
- `scripts/ops-thesis-updater.js` (new): deterministic carry-forward thesis writer; reads `dora-snapshot.json`, appends dated evidence block to `dora-thesis.md`; never overwrites prior content

#### CocoPull — Two Output Modes (Feature 35 Enhancement)
- `pull.skill.md` v1.1.0: `--human` flag produces `<target>.pull-human.md` — prose narrative for stakeholder consumption; not used by CocoHarvest; never overwrites machine `.pull.md`; Sonnet subagent with inverted-pyramid structure, 500-word cap, plain language constraint

---

## [1.1.0] — May 2026

### Added

#### CocoSentinel — Eight-Dimension Artifact Quality Gate (Feature 36)
- `sentinel.skill.md` — `$sentinel <file>` evaluates any artifact across eight dimensions: Security Attack Surface (A1), Defensive Posture (A2), Correctness (B), Performance (C), Maintainability (D), Test Coverage (E), Compliance (F), and Reward Hacking Resistance (G); Dimension G evidence pre-gate runs deterministically before any LLM work
- `sentinel-approve.skill.md` — `$sentinel approve` records SHA-256-bound approval for a CONDITIONAL artifact; approval is invalidated if the artifact changes
- `sentinel-report.skill.md` — `$sentinel --report` displays full evaluation history with outcomes and approval status per artifact
- `scripts/sentinel-pregate.js` — Dimension G binary PASS/FAIL in <50ms; evaluates 4 evidence criteria (consistent estimate, tool calls, test coverage signal, completion marker) and 3 reward hacking signals (threshold fabrication, coverage inflation, self-congratulation patterns); no LLM
- Seven parallel dimension agents: `sentinel-a1.agent.md` (Security Attack Surface), `sentinel-a2.agent.md` (Defensive Posture), `sentinel-b.agent.md` (Correctness), `sentinel-c.agent.md` (Performance), `sentinel-d.agent.md` (Maintainability), `sentinel-e.agent.md` (Test Coverage), `sentinel-f.agent.md` (Compliance)
- Lock file discipline: `active-evaluation.lock` prevents concurrent sentinel runs; stale lock cleanup (>10 min) in `subagent-stop.js`

#### CocoWisdom — Institutional Memory for Rejections (Feature 37)
- `wisdom.skill.md` — `$wisdom <file>` primes critics with prior rejection context before evaluation; reads `rejections.jsonl` to surface relevant past failures
- `wisdom-list.skill.md` — `$wisdom list` browses rejection records with optional `--gate`, `--since`, `--dimension` filters
- `wisdom-search.skill.md` — `$wisdom search "<pattern>"` full-text case-insensitive search across rejection reason, dimension, and gate fields
- `wisdom-insights.skill.md` — `$wisdom insights` produces a Haiku-synthesized pattern report from the rejection history
- `scripts/wisdom-writer.js` — append-only `rejections.jsonl` writer; auto-increments record IDs; lock file inside try block ensuring cleanup on any error path

#### CocoReview — Structured Code Review (Feature 38)
- `cocoreview.skill.md` — `$review <file>` progressive-disclosure code review; four phases: context gathering, high-level architecture, line-by-line, verdict; six-severity vocabulary: `blocking`, `important`, `nit`, `suggestion`, `learning`, `praise`; `praise` finding structurally mandatory in every review
- `scripts/pr-complexity.js` — deterministic PR complexity analyzer; computes `size_bucket` (XS/S/M/L/XL) and complexity score; XL artifacts (≥800 lines changed) trigger split recommendation; `fileCount` uses only `diff --git` lines; `nonTestChanges` uses subtraction without erroneous factor of 2
- `skills/cocoreview/universal-quality.md` — nine universal anti-pattern baseline applied before any language guide
- `skills/cocoreview/language-sql.md` — SQL-specific review guide
- `skills/cocoreview/security-review.md` — security review guide with five-tier severity scale
- `skills/cocoreview/architecture-review.md` — architecture review guide
- Review output committed to `.cocoplus/review/cocoreview-<timestamp>.md` with `docs(review):` commit type

#### CocoOps — Delivery Intelligence Dashboard (Feature 39)
- `cocoops.skill.md` — `$ops` dispatcher routing to DORA, sprint, suggest, and demo sub-commands
- `ops-dora.skill.md` — `$ops dora` computes four DORA-adapted metrics (Pipeline Run Frequency, Data Availability Lead, Failure Recovery Time, Data Quality Failure Rate); idempotent commit via `git diff --quiet`
- `ops-sprint.skill.md` — `$ops sprint` computes velocity, burndown, and completion prediction from git log within sprint window; daily burn rate and projected final velocity; idempotent commit
- `ops-demo.skill.md` — `$ops demo` activates demo mode with 4-pipeline synthetic dataset for evaluation; `--off` deactivates; `--reset` clears demo data
- `scripts/dora-metrics.js` — deterministic DORA computation; reads Snowflake task history and git log; uses `path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'cocoplus.toml')` for config; exits 0 with message when `.cocoplus/` absent
- `scripts/ops-suggest.js` — time-aware operational suggestion classifier; reads `dora-snapshot.json` for data-cited suggestions

#### CocoPlus Config — SSOT Sync (Phase 26 Extension)
- `cocoplus-config.skill.md` — `$cocoplus sync` propagates `cocoplus.toml` into `security-rules.json` and other derived config files; `$cocoplus migrate-config` converts legacy `safety-config.json` to `cocoplus.toml` format
- `templates/cocoplus.toml.template` — canonical single-source config with `[project]`, `[security]`, `[warehouses]`, `[cost]`, `[sprint]`, `[review.rules]`, and `[demo]` sections

### Updated

#### CocoFlow — Dual Synthesis Fallback (Phase 26 Extension)
- `flow-run.skill.md` — synthesis stages fall back to rule-based script on LLM failure via `--input` flag convention; execution stages still fail hard; prevents silent data loss on LLM synthesis timeout

#### SecondEye — Six-Severity Vocabulary (Phase 26 Extension)
- `secondeye.skill.md` — all five critic prompts extended with six-severity labels (`blocking`, `important`, `nit`, `suggestion`, `learning`, `praise`); `severity_counts` added to `action_summary`; report sections reorganized to Blocking/Important/Nits/Praise; praise structurally enforced — missing praise terminates with error
- `secondeye-critic.agent.md` — added `version`, `author`, `tags` frontmatter; `Severity` field added to output format

#### Safety Gate — Four-Tier Boundary Framework (Phase 26 Extension)
- `pre-tool-use.js` — Four-Tier Boundary Framework added (Absolute, Configurable, Advisory, Transparent); comment corrected from "EHRB still runs regardless" to "all checks including EHRB are bypassed" to match actual code behavior

#### Session Lifecycle — Archetypes and Index (Phase 26 Extension)
- `scripts/archetype-classifier.js` — classifies sessions into 5 archetypes (Explorer, Builder, Reviewer, Debugger, Planner) from turn count, duration, and tool use patterns
- `scripts/session-indexer.js` — rebuild/append modes; exits 0 (not 1) when `.cocoplus/` absent; used by `session-end.js` for cross-session FTS5 index

#### CocoBloom — Crystallized Skill Output Path (Phase 26 Extension)
- `bloom-crystallize.skill.md` — output path corrected from `.cocoplus/skills/` (runtime state) to `.cortex/skills/crystallized/` (cortex artifacts)

#### CocoPull — Full-Text Search (Phase 26 Extension)
- `pull-search.skill.md` — `$pull search "<query>"` searches distilled pull files via FTS5 index built by `session-indexer.js`

### Fixed

- `wisdom-writer.js` — lock file creation moved inside `try` block; previously a throw from `nextRecordId()` would strand the lock file permanently
- `session-end.js` — meter data captured into local variables before `fs.unlinkSync(meterFile)` call; previously the deleted file was re-read in step 3, producing zero-duration and zero-turn index entries
- `subagent-stop.js` — stale lock cleanup replaces dead-code sentinel-synthesis ID check; lock older than 10 minutes is removed as safety net
- `pr-complexity.js` — `fileCount` now counts only `diff --git` header lines (not `+++` lines which caused ~2× overcount); `nonTestChanges` removes erroneous `* 2` multiplier that could produce negative values; `Math.max(0, ...)` guard added
- `dora-metrics.js` — `.cocoplus/` existence check added at start of `main()`; `cocoplus.toml` read via `path.resolve(process.cwd(), ...)` to work from any working directory
- `session-indexer.js` — exits with code 0 (not 1) when `.cocoplus/` is absent; absence is not an error condition
- `sentinel.skill.md` — step number in "wait before proceeding" corrected from Step 7 to Step 8
- `ops-dora.skill.md`, `ops-sprint.skill.md` — idempotency check added; `git diff --quiet` skips commit when snapshot unchanged

## [1.0.3] — May 2026

### Added

#### Reference-Driven Implementation Sync
- Added `scripts/sync-docs-html.js` to render `docs/*.html` directly from the reference Markdown docs while preserving the existing documentation site shell and stylesheet.
- Added canonical reference skill paths for `cocobloom/bloom-skip.skill.md`, `cocowatch/SKILL.md`, and `cocohealth/pod-checkpoint.skill.md`.

- Expanded recipe templates into executable CocoFlow-style definitions with prompts, checkpoints, deliverables, validation commands, HITL flags, dependencies, and failure thresholds.
- Replaced simplified dashboard templates with the reference Flow View and Meter View templates.
- Strengthened deterministic helper scripts for scope classification, spec scoring, alignment checks, and guarded rollback execution.
- Extended `SubagentStop` routing for CocoKlatch participant/synthesis prefixes and CocoPull manifest updates.

## [1.0.2] — May 2026

### Added

#### CocoHealth — Context Utilization Monitor (Feature 27)
- `pod-checkpoint.skill.md` — `$pod checkpoint` writes a structured recovery snapshot to `lifecycle/checkpoint.md`; captures current phase, in-progress flow stage, last 5 decisions, open must-fix items, HITL stages awaiting approval, active CocoHarvest harvest status, and triggered seeds; includes Context Window Recovery Decision Matrix recommendation when context is at/near 70% utilization

#### CocoMap — Cortex Function Knowledge Graph (Feature 28)
- `map.skill.md` — `$map` triggers a 5-agent parallel analysis pipeline (Function Scanner, Dependency Mapper, Domain Analyzer, Evaluation Mapper, Gap Detector); agents write intermediate results to `.cocoplus/map/intermediate/` without returning to orchestrator context; merges into committed `coco-map.json` with structural dependency graph and domain intent map; creates git commit
- `map-diff.skill.md` — `$map diff` reads staged git changes and `coco-map.json` to trace downstream impact of modified functions before commit lands; shows affected dependents, shared evaluation sets, and capability definitions
- `map-explain.skill.md` — `$map explain <target>` produces natural-language explanation of a specific function, business capability, or vocabulary term from the committed knowledge graph

#### CocoSeed — Deferred Ideas with Trigger Conditions (Feature 29)

- `discuss.skill.md` — `$discuss` runs a structured wizard capturing model selection, evaluation methodology, accuracy threshold, warehouse assignment, production safety requirements, and scope boundaries into `lifecycle/discuss.md`; adapts questions to work type (AI function, Cortex Search, semantic model); auto-skips questions answered by CocoContext organizational standards; includes CocoSpec 5-dimension quality scoring gate (0–10, required ≥9) with Quick Mode bypass (skips Plan phase when score ≥9, scope ≤3 files, no EHRB indicators)

#### CocoGrove — Ubiquitous Language Section (Feature 12 improvement)
- `grove-glossary.skill.md` — `$grove glossary` scans project artifacts for domain vocabulary candidates and proposes additions to `.cocoplus/grove/language/glossary.md`; developer reviews and confirms each term before writing; creates git commit for accepted entries
- `grove-glossary-view.skill.md` — `$grove glossary view` displays the current glossary in alphabetical order with definitions, aliases, and associated functions

#### CocoPod — Project Knowledge Base (Feature 5 improvement)
- `pod-kb.skill.md` — `$pod kb` displays `lifecycle/kb.md` — the project-specific knowledge base populated by CocoCupper with Patterns, Decisions, and Gotchas across sessions; shows entry count by section and last update date

### Updated (Existing Features)

#### CocoBrew — Review Phase (Feature 1)
- `review.skill.md` — Decision Coverage Gate added: extracts key decisions from `plan.md` and `discuss.md`, scans implementation artifacts for evidence each decision is honored, flags Coverage Gaps as must-fix severity that block `$ship` until resolved or acknowledged with documented rationale

#### CocoBrew — Plan Phase (Feature 1 / Feature 30)
- `plan.skill.md` — CocoSpec pre-flight quality gate added as mandatory pre-plan step; spawns background Haiku scorer against 5 dimensions (Value, Scope, Acceptance, Boundaries, Risk) with 0–2 scoring; score ≥9 required; Quick Mode offered when score ≥9 + scope ≤3 files + no EHRB indicators; discuss.md is read and its decisions reflected in plan.md

#### CocoHarvest (Feature 3)
- `cocoharvest.skill.md` — added: CocoLens HITL/AFK classification per stage at decomposition time with developer override; Enhancement G adaptive parallelism (Normal → Caution → Single-track concurrency modes based on SubagentStop failure signals); stall detection by output token rate (threshold: 150 tokens/step, 5-step minimum, re-prompt before escalation); shell identity injection (COCOPLUS_FUNCTION, COCOPLUS_PERSONA, COCOPLUS_EVAL_ID, COCOPLUS_HARVEST_ID); consecutive failure escalation after 3 hard failures (configurable per stage); dual-file state initialization (`harvest/[run-id]-progress.txt` + `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json`) for context-reset recovery

#### CocoFlow — Execution Engine (Feature 6)
- `flow-run.skill.md` — added: `--concurrency <normal|caution|single-track>` flag to force concurrency mode for a run; dual-file state recovery on resume (reads `harvest/[run-id]-tasks.json` to skip already-completed stages); intermediate result persistence for parallel evaluation stages (detailed results to `.cocoplus/harvest/intermediate/`, only summaries return to orchestrator); HITL stage pausing with developer review before downstream stages spawn; consecutive failure tracking with escalation at threshold
- `flow-status.skill.md` — added Concurrency Mode field showing current mode and last transition trigger event; added HITL column to stage status table

#### Safety Gate (Feature 9)

#### SecondEye (Feature 19)
- `secondeye.skill.md` — added HITL/AFK classification per finding (HITL for Critical, architectural, or ambiguous findings; AFK for fix-pattern-mapped findings); added BLOCKING/MINOR classification (BLOCKING for correctness/security/architectural scope; MINOR for style/naming/non-critical coverage); report frontmatter gains `action_summary` with `hitl_count`, `afk_count`, `blocking_count`, `minor_count`
- `secondeye-acknowledge.skill.md` — added `--hitl-only` flag (acknowledge only HITL-classified findings; queue AFK for autonomous resolution) and `--blocking-only` flag (acknowledge only BLOCKING-classified findings; queue MINOR for autonomous resolution)

#### CocoScout (Feature 24)
- `cocoscout/SKILL.md` — added Two-Lens Relevance Ranking: Technical relevance (implementation approach) and Domain relevance (business intent), combined as weighted composite per persona type (DE/DS/AE: 70/30 technical/domain; DA/BI: 40/60; DPM/DST/CDO: 20/80); weights configurable in `plugin.json` under `cocoScout.weights`; added Anchor Lens: pre-compiled methodology vocabulary catalog at `grove/anchors/catalog.md`, pattern-matched against task message (<50ms, no LLM call), injects anchor names into build agent context preamble; per-persona anchor weighting; added `lifecycle/kb.md` as always-loaded low-tier context source for Build phase tasks; added CocoGrove glossary as context source ranked by term overlap

#### CocoPod — Status (Feature 5)
- `pod-status.skill.md` — added Project KB entry count to Section 6 (CocoGrove): shows "Project KB: N entries" or "Project KB: not yet populated"

### Notes
- Feature 31 (CocoLens) is integrated into CocoHarvest decomposition as a behavioral enhancement to `cocoharvest.skill.md` — no separate skill file required; HITL/AFK classification is applied automatically during plan decomposition with developer override available before spawning
